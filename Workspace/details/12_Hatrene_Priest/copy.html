This was a statue of priest from the ancient city of Hatra. The knee-length tunic depicted on the statue was characteristic of priests and represented the king in his priestly function. The statue was missing the head prior to its destruction. Crowdsourced images have only partially recovered its original geometry due to its placement in the the museum. If more images are found, the model could improve.
