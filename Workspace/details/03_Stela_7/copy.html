<pre>This large monument contains the best preserved iconography and text of this ancient Maya polity in northwestern Belize. It is carved on all four sides. The narrow sides have single columns of glyphs, a cruciform glyph panel of six glyphs is written on the back, and the front side of the stela faces west and shows a portrait of a ruler framed by hieroglyphic texts.The date written on the side of the stela is equivalent to November 28, 780 AD in our calendar.  A more detailed description is available from a publication by the Maya epigrapher, Nikolai Grube.

Due to natural erosion, this stela collapsed a few years ago. However, thanks to crowdsourced images from before and a planned acquisition project after, we can now virtually return the monument to its upright position and view the carved text that is now inaccessible.  Thanks to Bruce Templeton, Grant Aylesworth, and the Programme for Belize Archaeological Project for providing some of the images used for the model.
