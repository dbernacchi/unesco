          46 | 108 | Stela 7                                                | This is the best preserved stela at the site of La Milpa and the only one with a readable date. It is carved on all four sides with Maya glyphs. The front side, facing west, shows a ruler dressed in a elaborate costume. Unfortunately, erosion has destroyed most of the iconographic details since it was erected in 780 CE. Recently, the monument has collapsed due to continued environmental decay.
